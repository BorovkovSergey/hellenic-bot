# Hellenic Bot

> **This entire codebase was written by AI (Claude Code).** The human authored documentation, design specs, and shell scripts. All TypeScript code — API, bot, webapp, shared logic — was generated by Claude without any human code review. The repository is published as-is to demonstrate what AI-driven development looks like in practice.

## What is this

Hellenic Bot is a Telegram-based Greek language learning app. A user opens the bot, taps a button, and enters a mini-app where they learn Greek vocabulary through interactive exercises powered by spaced repetition.

The vocabulary comes from the ΚΛΙΚ στα ελληνικα textbook — currently 1,597 words with transcriptions, translations (English/Russian), and grammar notes.

## How it works for the learner

1. **Start the bot** in Telegram — it registers you and shows a button to open the learning app.
2. **Choose a mode**: Learn New (unseen words), Continue (words in progress), or Review (words you've already learned that are due for refreshing).
3. **Complete a lesson** — a set of exercises for each word, tailored to your current level with that word.
4. **Come back later** — the system schedules reviews at optimal intervals so you remember long-term.

## Exercise types

Words progress through stages, and exercise difficulty increases as you advance:

| Stage        | What you do                                            |
|:-------------|:-------------------------------------------------------|
| First time   | See a flashcard, then pick the right translation       |
| Early stages | Multiple choice in both directions (Greek/translation) |
| Mid stages   | Type the word yourself, unscramble letters             |
| Learned      | Production-only exercises to maintain retention        |

Getting a word wrong rolls it back. Getting it right advances it. Zero errors on all exercises for a word = promotion to the next stage.

## Spaced repetition

The system uses a 6-stage SRS algorithm. Best case: a word goes from "new" to "learned" in 3 days of zero-error practice. Mistakes cause the word to stay at the current stage or roll back, so difficult words get more repetitions naturally.

## How it was built

The human wrote:
- All documentation (`docs/` folder) — architecture, API spec, bot UX, lesson flow, deployment guide, task breakdowns
- Design principles and coding rules (`CLAUDE.md`)
- Shell scripts and deployment configuration
- The glossary source material

Claude Code wrote:
- All TypeScript code (~3,000 lines across 36 files)
- Database schema and migrations
- API endpoints with authentication
- Telegram bot handlers
- React mini-app with 5 exercise components
- Docker configuration for all services

The human never reviewed the TypeScript. The process was: write detailed specs, let Claude implement them, deploy, test as a user, file bugs or feature requests as new specs, repeat.

## Tech stack

Full-stack TypeScript monorepo: Hono (API), grammY (Telegram bot), React + Vite (mini-app), PostgreSQL + Drizzle ORM (database), Zod (validation), pnpm + Turborepo (monorepo tooling). Deployed via Docker Compose on a VPS.
